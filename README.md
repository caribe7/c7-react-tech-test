# Caribe7 Front-end Engineer Technical Test

This repo has been generated using create-react-app from the React team.

The endpoint https://api.caribe7.com/events/random returns a random virtual sports event from our database.
Please take your time to have a look at the JSON output, and ask relevant questions to your interviewer 
if necessary.

Clone this repo, create a branch named after you, and implement the relevant HTML/CSS/Javascript/React code that accomplish the following requirements:

- Show to the end user: event id, event description, event start time, class id, class description number of runners, list of runners
- If the event status is "SCHEDULED" or "OPEN", display a live countdown for its start time
- If the event status is "CLOSED" just show the time when it took place
- Make the application call the API every 60 seconds and update the front-end accordingly

### Rules

- Implement all the best practices you know, including testing
- React can be implemented with an OOP approach, take advantage of that to show any OOP skills you have
- The endpoint is spiteful, make sure you handle errors
- You don't have to make a beautiful front-end, we don't expect you to be a designer. We do expect though that the output is responsive 
so make sure you implement relevant technologies or practices for that

Commit and push your work when you have finished.
At the end of the time you have been given, we don't expect you top have completed the full task. Your interviewer is interested in 
your approach to coding, so don't be nervous if you don't reach all the goals within the time frame.

Good luck!
